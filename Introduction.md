# Introduction
# Data Science Project: Tommies or Tatties?

## Overview

This project uses a publicly available dataset which provides data on the cost of various ingredients, including potatoes ('tatties') and tomatoes ('tommies'), between the years 2013 and 2021.

The goal of this project is to explore the use of a time series forecast model as a tool to decide which main ingredient to use (tatties or tommies) for the soup of the month, based on the predicted cost of the two ingredients.

A SARIMA forecasting model was used to forecast cost of ingredients 12 months ahead. The results were then uploaded to PowerBI to create an interactive dashboard whereby the end-user can select the purchase month and be advised on which ingredient to buy according to how the forecasted price compared to the average price for that ingredient, and the price of the alternative ingredient.

### Positive Impact
The business will be able to make data-driven business decisions in order to optimise profit.

### Negative Impact
The forecast may influence the use of a certain ingredient at a time when that ingredient is of poor quality, leading to problems further down the line such as customer disatisfaction, the requirement to use additional ingredients to improve the quality of the soup.
