# Business Impact
This project has produced a tool for an organisation to use to make cost effective business decisions. 

With this tool, the individuals are able to forecast future costs and make decisions on which ingredients they will buy and when. The tool allows them to plan the menu in advance, which will enable them to produce marketing materials in a timely manner, and advertise to their customers. This will hopefully boost customer interest. Therefore the tool has two financial benefits:
* Ability to purchase cost efficiently
* Increased customer interest through well-planned, timely marketing
