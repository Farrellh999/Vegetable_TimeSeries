# Business Impact
This project has produced a tool for an organisation to use to make cost effective business decisions. 

With this tool, the individuals are able to forecast future costs and make decisions on which ingredients they will buy and when. The tool allows them to plan the menu in advance, which will enable them to produce marketing materials in a timely manner, and advertise to their customers. This will hopefully boost customer interest. The tool also allows for the chef to foresee future fluctations in price and plan accordingly; perhaps reviewing a recipe to include less of the ingredient when prices are higher, and more of an ingredient when the prices are lower, thus monopolising on the flucuations.

Therefore the tool has the following financial benefits:
* Ability to purchase ingredients cost efficiently.
* Increased customer interest through well-planned, timely marketing.
* Better use of marketing resources.
* Improved cash management through predicting periods of higher costs and amending recipes to be more financially viable.

The tool also allows the chef to observe long term trends and monitor business decisions accordingly. For example, increasingly higher prices may lead to the chef making cuts in other areas in order to continue the 'soup of the day', or perhaps changing the business plan all together and choosing not to have a 'soup of the day'.
