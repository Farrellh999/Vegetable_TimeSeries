# Data Science Project: Tommies or Tatties?

# Overview

This project uses a publicly available dataset which provides data on the cost of various ingredients, including potatoes ('tatties') and tomatoes ('tommies'), between the years 2013 and 2021.

The goal of this project is to explore the use of a time series forecast model as a tool to decide which main ingredient to use (tatties or tommies) for the soup of the month, based on the predicted cost of the two ingredients.

A SARIMA forecasting model was used to forecast cost of ingredients 12 months ahead. The results were then uploaded to PowerBi to create an interactive dashboard whereby the user can select the purchase month and be advised on which ingredient to buy according to how the forecasted price compared to the average price for that ingredient, and the price of the alternative ingredient.

### Positive Impact
The business will be able to make data-driven business decisions in order to optimise profit.

### Negative Impact
The forecast may influence the use of a certain ingredient at a time when that ingredient is of poor quality, leading to problems further down the line such as customer disatisfaction, the requirement to use additional ingredients to improve the quality of the soup.

# Project Background
A chef must decide what the 'soup of the day' will be for the following month, ready to advertise to customers, based on the price of the main ingredient. This project focuses on assessing the forecasted price of the the two main ingredients potatoes ('tatties') and tomatoes ('tommies').

Whilst the raw data is daily, it was decided to transform this into monthly data as the original dataset made the python kernel run too slowly.

A time series SARIMA forecasting model is run following data cleansing in python. The auto-arima function uses AIC to detect the best fitting parameters of p,d,q, and P,D,Q using the test dataset. The model is then run on the training dataset and the model accuracy is assessed using r-squared, mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), in addition to a visual inspection.

Once satisfied with the model, the next 12 months are forecast and then merged into the original dataframe, before being exported to a csv file.

The chosen model is imported into Power BI and visualisations are produced into a dashboard to imprpve accessibilty to the data and for clear decision making.

## Solution

## Outcome

## Import the datasets and explore

## Check for null values and types of data
<img width="422" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a335fcd4-3422-47e8-b711-67cb40c77c2e" />

There are no null values present and the data types appear accurate.

## Plot the time series data

## Observe for any trends with rolling mean calculated

## Decompose the time series
<img width="684" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee6b378a-1b10-4c67-8e5e-f7feaacb7cf5" />

<img width="644" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48a286d8-3342-4c22-9ac2-c7705c896dd3" />

The decomposition demonstrates a long-term increase in the average prices. There are certain points of price acceleration and price deceleration. The seasonal plot appears very flat, indicating there isn't strong seasonal variation. The residual plot doesn't indicate any specific pattern, with fluctuations being scattered and therefore random.

The primary driver for average price of tatties appers to be a general increase over time, with very little impact from seasonsality, not any systematic error.

Following these observations, it would be best to proceed with an ARIMA model.

### Check for outliers by producing a Z score and identifying records with a price 4 SD away from the mean.

### Perform the SARIMA model
Ensure correct libraries are installed.

Fit the model with the auto-arima function.

<img width="293" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c86f2486-0611-4e4e-8876-656c38692958" />

<img width="433" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52b6fa14-e6e6-41d5-ba92-79dcbba2d029" />

<img width="539" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36cc63eb-1ced-42d5-9059-0cde41785f2a" />

The auto-arima function has detected that there is no seasonality, and the best fitting model has order (p,d,q)(2,0,1) i.e., there autoregressive element and a moving average element.

### Check model fit
Perform residual analysis
<img width="344" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1bdfed9-376c-4737-88c8-590de30e5ac9" />
<img width="745" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f726045-93fb-4c76-8e03-8ca8958d9d4e" />

Residual analysis demonstrates that the majority of the residuals are close to zero, indicating a good model fit. The residuals also demonstrate a relatively normal distribution.

Plot ACF residuals

ACF plot demonstrates no significant correlation.

### Compare Model Results with Actual
<img width="652" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/300a2b1a-9dfa-4e9e-a981-6daa451eb255" />

From a visual inspection, the model does reflect the pattern fo the actual data, but it doensn't look particularly accurate.

### Check the forecast accuracy

<img width="521" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bcff958-9da6-4fc4-b61a-28bb3e915116" />

The mean average percentage error (MAPE) is 29%, indicating a relatively poor fitting model.
